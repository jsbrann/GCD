Getting &amp; Cleaning Data Coursera final project

This project is an exercise in getting and cleaning data. The dataset used is accelerometer data collected from smartphones while test subjects performed certain physical activities. The full description of the original data set can be found at:

The CodeBook.md file in this repository explains the methods used by the run_analysis.R script to extract and compile the tidy data set, which is found in the file tidy.txt. The tidy.mean.txt file further refines the tidy.txt data, averaging each variable for each activity and subject.
